As part of college academics, with a team of four, I have designed a database management model to simulate music storage in popular music player applications like Spotify, Apple-Music etc.

## Project Description:
The Music Database System's Entity-Relationship (ER) Diagram provides a visual
representation of the structural framework underlying our comprehensive
music database. Through meticulous design, we have mapped out the
interrelationships between entities such as artists, albums, tracks, genres, and
users, capturing the intricate web of data crucial for efficient music
management. This ER Diagram serves as a blueprint for our database
implementation, facilitating seamless organization, retrieval, and analysis of
music-related information. With a clear depiction of entity attributes and their
associations, our system ensures robust functionality and scalability to meet
the diverse needs of music enthusiasts, industry professionals, and
researchers alike

### Diagrams:
| ER | Schema |
